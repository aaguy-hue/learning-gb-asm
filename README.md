# learning-gb-asm
The hello world program is from https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/, and I'm making the breakout game based on the parts of the tutorial released so far (1 - 4).

Hopefully, I can look back on this in the future and see how I learned over time.

Currently, I am using rgbds v0.6.0, so you should probably use that as well in order to run my code.
