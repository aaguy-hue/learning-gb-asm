things to do:
- make blocks disappear when hit
- keeping score
- adding something like "YOU LOSE!"

things to improve:
- ball-paddle collision code
- CollideBall function

things that are done:
- drawing a ball
- drawing a paddle
- drawing a background
- drawing bricks
- ball-paddle collisions
- ball-brick collisions

bugs:
- hitting the ball from the side causes the game to stutter and eventually crash
- hitting the wall with the paddle causes the game to stutter and eventually crash
- sometimes, the ball randomly gets stuck in the blocks
  - this bug will probably not happen once I make blocks disappear, so it's probably not that important
