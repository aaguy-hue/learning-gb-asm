things to do:
- keeping score
- adding something like "YOU LOSE!"

things in progress:
- ball-brick collisions
  - if ball hits side of brick, reverse the x
  - if ball hits bottom or top of brick, reverse the y

things to improve:
- ball-paddle collision code
- CollideBall function

things that are done:
- drawing a ball
- drawing a paddle
- drawing a background
- drawing bricks
- ball-paddle collisions

bugs:
